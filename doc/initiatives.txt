Problem
We have a lot of initiatives.  These each have a PM, a message thread, a group of stakeholders, an associated schedule/deadline, and tickets.  Possibly even sub-milestones.  

There is no "initiative" view in lighthouse.  We could hack in on in one of two ways:

1) Milestones
Those are project-specific, don't have message thread, stakeholder list, or a PM. 

2) Tickets
We could have a ticket+milestone represent an initiative.  We would keep these in an Initiatives project, they would have a message thread, stakeholders, and a PM.  The milestone would have to be copied over to all other projects, and we'd have to keep that list of IDs somewhere.

Initiative
-has a PM
-has a thread of messages
-has a deadline
-has tickets

Thought:
-what's the simplest we could do?
