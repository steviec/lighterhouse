Project management requirements:

v. 0.0
high level
-Top:
--simple milestone view of tickets
--shows expected date in milestone dropdown
-L buckets: list of each dev + tickets (unordered)
-R bucket: all other tix; can filter by unassigned, project
-Bottom:
--shows simple view of tickets

Actions:
-drag tickets from R bucket to L user

details
-cache all tix locally
-simple wrapper that keeps order of tickets per dev per project

==============

v. 0.1
-mass assign/close/move tickets (clickable)
-add initiatives(milestones), filtering
-initiatives
--same as milestones?  or super-set that has multiple milestones?
--start/end dates
--message log of updates to the initiative
--PM indicated

v. 0.2
- all devs view
-- list of devs' tickets in separate columns
-- filter by milestone or specific devs
-- on-ice column on R; can drag into on-deck list for different devs
-- status: open = on-ice
-- status: scheduled = on-deck
-- status: in-progress = top of list, colored differently
-- show ticket priority (simple ordering)

v. 0.3
- calendar view
-- see all milestones across projects on a calendar timeline
-+ draggable milestone times

v. 0.4
fun to have
- email after deploy
-- lists devs/tickets with hotlinks to LH

biggest problems:
- how to save list ordering for each dev on LH? checkout API
-- acts_as_list, store in sqlite
- should open tix be on-ice, and scheduled tix be on-deck?
-- what if you just want to see each dev and all tix associated?

========

lighterhouse:
-initiative by initiative, see all user tickets basis
-e.g. email blast, needs:

erik:
-collect links, write email

bekcy:
-vet email

jeff:
-execute email

=======================

flow
-need to have a vetting process with projects
-before deployment!  closed, qa, deployed
